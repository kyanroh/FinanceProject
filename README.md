Finance Project - formulating 3 different risk level portfolios based on data from 15 years 
Asset management is a very old industry with very solid incumbents who have accumulated extraordinary “war chests”, so to speak. However, in recent years, world-wide, we have experienced what is often
referred to as an “uberization” of the economy, with radical changes coming from digital innovation.
This digital revolution is slowly starting to impact the asset management industry. Many platforms
offer what is called “robo advisors”. However, this approach has many limitations, in particular leaving
investors with a tool requiring advanced knowledge of finance to construct their own portfolios. That
is limited progress made in terms of filling customer needs. The proposal is to offer a turnkey solution.

This project aims to use data of ETFs from the past and come up with 3 different portfolios with different risk levels to suit investors with different preferences
